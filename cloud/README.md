# Nebulous serverless app demonstrating use of Google Cloud APIs
### Featuring the Cloud Translation API

## Description

This is the code repo for a set of codelab tutorials highlighting a "nebulous" sample app demonstrating how to access Google Cloud APIs from one of our serverless platforms. There are [Python](python) and [Node.js](nodejs) versions of this app available.

## Inspiration and implementation

This code sample was inspired by a [user's suboptimal experience](https://www.mail-archive.com/google-appengine@googlegroups.com/msg94549.html) trying to create a simple App Engine app using a Cloud API. It was also inspired by a [colleague's blog post](https://dev.to/googlecloud/portable-code-migrating-across-google-cloud-s-serverless-platforms-2ifk) showing a similar Node.js example "drifting" between GCP serverless platforms.

This app shows developers how to use the [Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate), the API for [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com), and one of GCP's [AI/ML "building block" APIs](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308144225/https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/building-blocks). Such APIs are backed by pre-trained machine learning models, allowing developers with little or no background in AI/ML to leverage machine learning with only API calls. The application implements a mini Google Translate "MVP" (minimally-viable product) web service.


## Authentication and authorization: service account credentials (local deployments only)

Google Cloud compute platforms feature [default service account credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#default) which are used for these app deployments. However, such credentials are not available when running locally, so users will need to **run** `gcloud auth application-default login` before starting the server.


## Cost

While the Translation API does not explicitly list a free quota on the ["Always Free" tier page](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#free-tier-usage-limits), its [pricing page](https://cloud.google.com/translate/pricing#charged-characters) indicates a certain number of [translated characters](https://cloud.google.com/translate/pricing#charged-characters) as a free monthly quota applied as a credit, so long as you stay within that limit, you should not incur any additional charges.


## Enable Google Cloud services used

Once you have a billing account, you can enable the services/APIs for each product used. Go to the Cloud console pages for each respective Cloud product used and enable the service:

1. [App Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine)
1. [Cloud Functions](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions)
1. [Cloud Run](https://console.cloud.google.com/run)
1. [Cloud Translation](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/translate.googleapis.com)

Alternatively, you use the [`gcloud` CLI (command-line interface)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) available from the [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk). Review the [Cloud SDK install instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) if needed. New users should also reference the [`gcloud` cheatsheet](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/cheatsheet).

Enable all required services (serverless platforms plus Cloud Translation and Artifact Registry for containers) with this one CLI command: `gcloud services enable appengine.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com cloudfunctions.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com translate.googleapis.com` If you don't have billing enabled or don't have a valid billing account, you'll be notified here.


## The application itself

The app consists of a simple web page prompting the user for a phrase to translate from English to Spanish. The translated results along with the original phrase are presented along with an empty form for a follow-up translation if desired.

This is what the app looks like after completing one translation (Cloud Run version):
