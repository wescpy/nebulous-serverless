# Nebulous serverless Cloud Translation API app

| :boom: Jan 2024 update |
|:---------------------------|
| Python 2.7 apps can no longer be deployed on App Engine. Either upgrade to 3.8+ or migrate your app to Cloud Run or other platform that still supports Python 2. More information is available in the ["What you need to know" deprecation post](https://dev.to/wescpy/python-app-engine-jan-2024-deprecation-what-you-need-to-know-4bci). |


## Python (2 and 3) version

While the majority of this app's deployments are in Python 3, there are still users upgrading from Python 2, so our Python 2 code is meant to help with migration &amp; planning. Admittedly, there may _seem_ to be a bit of "cheating" due to the duplicity of Python 2 and 3, especially since the application is compatible across both language versions without modification or use of compatibility libraries. However there are significant differences between Python 2 and 3 deployment requirements irregardless of language differences. Additional notes:

- For local or Cloud Run deployments, there are little/no updates to go from Python 2 to 3.
- Neither Cloud Functions nor Cloud Run with Cloud Buildpacks support Python 2.
- There is also an [equivalent Node.js version](../nodejs) of this app.

## Deployments and their files

These are the files provided in this repo and the deployments they're applicable to:

![repository files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1102504/119735453-2f3af500-be31-11eb-9115-3fdeb22ec31c.png)

> NOTES:
>- * &mdash; `requirements.txt` is used for local and App Engine (2.x) package installations and not required in deployments themselves unlike all others
>- `main.py` and `templates/index.html` comprise the entire application and are always required
>- `noxfile.py` and `test_translate.py` are for testing only; see [Testing section](#testing) below
>- All `.*ignore` and `.git*` files/folders are administrative and not listed in table above or deployments below
>- Files applicable only to a specific language version are annotated above

Below are the required settings and instructions for all documented deployments. The "**TL:DR;**" section at the top of each configuration summarizes the key files (see above) while the table beneath spells out the details. No administrative files are listed.

> NOTE: Serverless deployments (as configured here) use [default service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#default) which provide a broad set of permissions to assist you in getting a working prototype. When preparing to launch to production, the Google Cloud team recommends the best practice of "least privileges," and instead use [user-managed service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#user-managed) with the minimal set of permissions allowing your app to function properly.

File | Description
--- | ---
~~`main.py`~~|~~**use as-is** from repo~~
~~`app.yaml`~~|~~**use as-is** from repo (ensure `#runtime:python312` commented out)~~

    - ~~You'll be prompted for the REGION if deploying to App Engine the first time.~~
    - ~~App Engine apps are tied to one region, so it can't be changed once it's set, meaning you won't be prompted thereafter.~~


## **App Engine (Python 3)**

**TL;DR:** app files plus `app.yaml`

File | Description
--- | ---
`main.py`|**use as-is** from repo
`app.yaml`|**uncomment** `runtime:python312` (or Python 3.8-3.12); **delete** all other lines

Instructions:

1. **Edit** `app.yaml` (see above)
1. (optional) **Delete** `app.yaml`, `lib` and `appengine_config.py` (unused)
1. **Run** `gcloud app deploy` to deploy to Python 3 App Engine
    - You'll be prompted for the REGION if deploying to App Engine the first time.
    - App Engine apps are tied to one region, so it can't be changed once it's set, meaning you won't be prompted thereafter.


## **Cloud Functions (Python 3)**

**TL;DR:** app files

File | Description
--- | ---
`main.py`|**use as-is** from repo
`app.yaml`|_unused_ (delete or leave as-is; only for App Engine)
`appengine_config.py`|_unused_ (delete)

`lib`|**delete** (or rename) this folder if it exists (not used with Cloud Functions)
`Dockerfile`|_unused_ (delete or leave as-is)
`Procfile`|_unused_ (delete or leave as-is)

Instructions:

1. (optional) **Delete** `app.yaml`, `lib` and `appengine_config.py` (unused)
1. **Run** `gcloud functions deploy translate --runtime python312 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated` to deploy to Cloud Functions (or Python 3.8-3.12)
    - That command creates &amp; deploys a new HTTP-triggered Cloud Function (name must match what's in `main.py`)
    - You'll be prompted for the REGION if deploying a Cloud Function the first time.
    - Cloud Functions can be deployed to different regions within a project, but once the region has been set for a function, it cannot be changed.
1. There is no support for Python 2 with Cloud Functions


## **Cloud Run (Python 2 via Docker)**

**TL;DR:** app files plus `Dockerfile`

File | Description
--- | ---
`main.py`|**use as-is** from repo
`app.yaml`|_unused_ (delete or leave as-is; only for App Engine)
`appengine_config.py`|_unused_ (delete)
`requirements.txt`|`grpcio<1.40.0` applies to this deployment
`lib`|**delete** (or rename) this folder if it exists (not used with Cloud Run)
`Dockerfile`|**use as-is** from repo (ensure `#FROM python:3-slim` commented out)
`Procfile`|_unused_ (delete or leave as-is)

Instructions:

1. (optional) **Delete** `app.yaml`, `lib` and `appengine_config.py` (unused)
1. **Run** `gcloud run deploy translate --allow-unauthenticated --platform managed` to deploy to Cloud Run
    - The above command wraps `docker build` and `docker push`, deploying the image to [Cloud Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry) (must be enabled), and finally `docker run` to deploy the service, all in one convenient command.
    - You'll be prompted to provide a REGION unless you also add `--region REGION` on the cmd-line
    - You'll be prompted to provide a SOURCE folder unless you also add `--source FOLDER`, e.g., `--source .` on the cmd-line
    - Supplying both `--region` and `--source` options provide a fully non-interactive deploy (unless you don't have a repository, in which case you'll be prompted to create one)
1. You can also use this shortcut to deploy to Cloud Run:
    [![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run)
1. By default, App Engine &amp; Cloud Functions launch production servers; with Cloud Run, the Flask development server is used for prototyping. For production, bundle and deploy a production server like `gunicorn`:
    1. **Uncomment** `gunicorn` from `requirements.txt` (commented out for App Engine &amp; Cloud Functions)
    1. **Uncomment** the `ENTRYPOINT` entry for `gunicorn` replacing the default entry in `Dockerfile`
    1. Re-use the same deploy command

`lib`|**delete** (or rename) this folder if it exists (not used with Cloud Run)
`Dockerfile`|**replace** `FROM python:2-slim` with `FROM python:3-slim` (commented out) but **keep all other lines**
`Procfile`|_unused_ (delete or leave as-is)

Instructions:

1. (optional) **Delete** `app.yaml`, `lib` and `appengine_config.py` (unused)
1. **Edit** `Dockerfile` (see above)
1. **Run** `gcloud run deploy translate --allow-unauthenticated --platform managed` to deploy to Cloud Run
    - The above command wraps `docker build` and `docker push`, deploying the image to [Cloud Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry) (must be enabled), and finally `docker run` to deploy the service, all in one convenient command.
    - You'll be prompted to provide a REGION unless you also add `--region REGION` on the cmd-line
    - You'll be prompted to provide a SOURCE folder unless you also add `--source FOLDER`, e.g., `--source .` on the cmd-line
    - Supplying both `--region` and `--source` options provide a fully non-interactive deploy (unless you don't have a repository, in which case you'll be prompted to create one)
1. The shortcut "button" above can be customized for Python 3 if you make the `Dockerfile` update above and commit it to your fork/clone.
1. By default, App Engine &amp; Cloud Functions launch production servers; with Cloud Run, the Flask development server is used for prototyping. For production, bundle and deploy a production server like `gunicorn`:
    1. **Uncomment** `gunicorn` from `requirements.txt` (commented out for App Engine &amp; Cloud Functions)

## Testing

Testing is driven by [`nox`](http://nox.thea.codes) which uses [`pytest`](https://pytest.org) for testing and [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org) for linting, installing both in virtual environments along with application dependencies, `flask` and `google-cloud-translate`, and finally, `blinker`, a signaling framework integrated into Flask. To run the lint and unit tests (testing `GET` and `POST` requests), install `nox` (with the expected `pip install -U nox`) and run it from the command line in the application folder and ensuring `noxfile.py` is present.
