# Google Gemini API serverless web app samples
These are the code samples that are found in the 4th post _(upcoming)_ in the [series introducing the Gemini API](https://dev.to/wescpy/series/27183).


| :exclamation: API key required |
|:---------------------------|
| An API key is required to use Google's Gemini API. Follow the instructions below. The app will ***not*** run without a `.env` file (Node.js) or `settings.py` (Python)s, whether for running locally or for _testing/prototyping_ serverless cloud deployments. However, for _production_ cloud deployments, rather than local files, use environment variables or GCP [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) instead. |


| :exclamation: GCP "is not free" |
|:---------------------------|
| GCP services aren't free, however all its serverless platforms have free quota available before you incur billing. Be sure to review the ["Costs" section in the top-level `README`](https://github.com/wescpy/nebulous-serverless#cost). If you are doing this as an event workshop, it's likely you were given GCP credits for a small amount in order to give you access to GCP and its services... refer to those instructions as necessary. |


## Table of contents
There are two versions of the sample app, Node.js and Python. Below are the files in each folder and their purpose. Pick one or both apps to try for yourself.


### Node.js
File | Description | Platform
--- | --- | ---
[`nodejs/main.js`](/multi/webgem/nodejs/main.js) | Express.js sample app | Node (CommonJS)
[`nodejs/main.mjs`](/multi/webgem/nodejs/main.mjs) | Express.js sample app | Node (modern JS/ECMAScript module)
[`nodejs/templates/index.html`](/multi/webgem/nodejs/templates/index.html) | Web template | Nunjucks (identical to Jinja2)
[`nodejs/app.yaml`](/multi/webgem/nodejs/app.yaml) | Config file | App Engine
[`nodejs/Dockerfile`](/multi/webgem/nodejs/Dockerfile) | (optional) Dockerfile | Cloud Run (**with** Docker)
[`nodejs/package.json`](/multi/webgem/nodejs/package.json) |  3rd-party packages file | Node


### Python
File | Description | Platform
--- | --- | ---
[`python/main.py`](/multi/webgem/python/main.py) | Flask sample app | Python 3
[`python/templates/index.html`](/multi/webgem/python/templates/index.html) | Web template | Jinja2 (identical to Nunjucks)

[`python/requirements.txt`](/multi/webgem/python/requirements.txt) |  3rd-party packages file | Python


## Instructions
For GCP serverless platform deployments, [install the Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) which includes the `gcloud` CLI command. While _Node 18+_ and _Python 3.9+_ are recommended, prior releases may also work. The code was built & tested with current versions of Node (20 or 22) and Python 3 (3.11 or 3.12). After cloning the repo, go to the desired folder, `nodejs` or `python`.

Python developers have the option to [create & activate a virtual environment ("virtualenv") for isolation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments) with the `python -m venv <NAME>` (or `python3`) followed by `source <NAME>/bin/activate` where `NAME` can be something like `env` or `myvenv`.


### Run locally
The local deployment of this web app is nearly identical to the code sample demonstrated in this [blog post](https://dev.to/wescpy/gemini-api-102a-putting-together-a-basic-genai-web-app-3e3), the third in the series linked up top. The only difference between versions: the original version, v0.1, is only available for local deployments while this v0.2 release has all the extra config files so it can be deployed to GCP serverless platforms as well as locally. This means these startup instructions are the same as what's in that post:

1. [Create API key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and...
    - **Node.js**: Set in `.env` file as `API_KEY = <YOUR_API_KEY>;`
    - ^**Python**: Set in `settings.py` file as `API_KEY = '<YOUR_API_KEY>'`
1. Install packages (either from scratch or a 3rd-party packages file):
    - **Node.js** (from `package.json`): `npm up`
    - **Python** (from `requirements.txt`): `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `pip3`)
    - OR
    - **Node.js** (from scratch): `npm i dotenv express multer nunjucks sharp @google/generative-ai`
    - **Python** (from scratch): `pip install -U pip flask pillow google-generativeai` (or `pip3`)
1. Start local web server:
    - **Node.js**: `npm start` (runs `node main.mjs`) or `node main.js`
    - **Python**: `python main.py` (or `python3`)

<sup>^</sup> â€” Alternatively for Python, instead of `settings.py`, you can save it to `.env` but would need to install `python-dotenv` and add the code to use it if you want to more closely mirror the Node version.


### Deploy to and run on Google Cloud
For all cloud deployments, the commands for Node.js and Python are identical. The local deployment step of installing packages is not required as they will automatically be installed in the cloud per `package.json` (Node.js) and/or `requirements.txt` (Python). (And definitely don't start a local "devserver.")


#### App Engine (GAE)
1. Create API key per instructions above for local deployments (`.env` or `settings.py` okay for testing/prototypes; for product, use Secret Manager [see sidebar above])
1. [Create new project or reuse existing one](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects); confirm [assigned billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project).
1. Update Node.js or Python versions in `app.yaml` as desired.
1. Deploy app to the cloud with `gcloud app deploy`
    - On first deploy, you may be prompted to...
        1. Assign billing account if you haven't already done so
        1. Enable service or to create an App Engine app
        1. Set its (fixed) [region](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/locations). App Engine apps cannot be moved, so the region choice is permanent (app is still accessible globally). Cloud Run does ***not*** have this restriction.


#### Cloud Functions (GCF)
Cloud Functions is a product generally used for microservices, simple functions, or short mobile backend requests, not entire web apps. As this is a _basic_ (single-function) web app, I may try to get it working on GCF in the future, or more likely, on its 2nd-gen successor platform, Cloud Run Functions (GCRF). If I did, the deploy command may be similar to what's crossed-out below:

1. ~~Create API key per instructions above.~~
1. ~~Run `gcloud functions deploy genai --runtime PLATFORM --entry-point app --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated`~~
    - ~~**Node.js**: Use  `nodejs20` or `nodejs22` for `PLATFORM`.~~
    - ~~**Python**: Use  `python311` or `python312` for `PLATFORM`.~~


#### Cloud Run (GCR)
1. Create API key per instructions above.
1. [Create new project or reuse existing one](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects); confirm [assigned billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project).
1. Perform pre-deployment tweaks/adjustments as necessary:
    - Deployments ***using Docker***:
        - Update Node.js or Python versions in `Dockerfile` as desired.
        - The `Procfile` is unused and may be deleted if desired.
    - Deployments ***without using Docker***:
        - Deleting the `Dockerfile` is **required**.
        - [Cloud Buildpacks](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/buildpacks) automatically detects your language, selects a [default runtime version](https://cloud.google.com/docs/buildpacks/builders), and builds the containerized app
        - Update startup/"entrypoint" instructions in `Procfile` as desired.
1. Deploy app ("service") to the cloud with `gcloud run deploy genai --allow-unauthenticated --platform managed --source .`
    - Service name "genai" can be changed
    - On first deploy, you may be prompted to...
        1. Assign billing account if you haven't already done so
        1. Enable Cloud Run service or Cloud Artifact Registry
    - Optionally specify a [region](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/locations), e.g., `--region us-west1`, otherwise you'll be given a list to choose from.


| :memo: Gemini API also accessible from GCP Vertex AI |
|:---------------------------|
| While these sample apps access the Gemini API from Google AI, a great place for beginners and those experimenting with it, the API is also accessible from GCP's Vertex AI platform for those ready to use Gemini for production workloads in the cloud. To learn more about calling the Gemini API from either place (or both), see my "A better Gemini API 'Hello World!' sample" [blog post](https://dev.to/wescpy/a-better-google-gemini-api-hello-world-sample-4ddm), the first in the series linked up top.
